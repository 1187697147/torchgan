Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

Contributions in all forms are always welcome. Follow the following guidelines while contributing :-

1. If contributing a ``new feature``, first open an issue on github. Describe the feature and provide some references. Also clarify why it shall be a good feature to have in the ``core library`` and not simply as a ``representative example``.
2. If submitting a ``bug fix``, file the issue on github. Make sure the bug exists on the ``master``.
3. If submitting a ``new model``, open a PR in the ``model zoo`` repository. Follow the contribution guidelines present there.
4. Also fell free to submit ``documentation changes``.

For you PR to be merged it must strictly adhere to the style guidelines, we use ``flake8`` for that purpose. Also all existing tests must pass. No breaking changes will be accepted unless when we are making a change in the ``major version``. Also be sure to add ``tests`` and ``documentation`` for any code that you submit.
